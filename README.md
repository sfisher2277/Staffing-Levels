# Staffing-Levels

I evaluated the impacts of the gap in projected and actual staffing levels on company performance. I also looked at the financial aspect of these impacts. Differences in expected pilot staffing and actual staffing led to flight cancellations.

Although there can be some margin in promising more flights than the company has staff for, due to incentivized overtime, how big that margin can be before negative impacts and performance is the million dollar question.

The increase in the cost of the incentivized shifts is also a factor, as that cost eats into the profits from the additional revenue they were intended to generate.


The result of this project led to a formula the company could use to determine how far beyond obvious capacity it could plan, and still be reasonably sure the committments could be met based on seven years of data. This led to additional revenue, while improving reliability and internal and external customer satisfaction. Adjusting for fluctuations during the COVID pandemic was particularly satisfying.
