# Staffing Level Impacts

I evaluated the impacts of the gap in projected and actual staffing levels on company performance. I also looked at the financial aspect of these impacts. Differences in expected pilot staffing and actual staffing led to flight cancellations and the company needed a way to avoid this in the future.

Although there can be some margin in promising more flights than the company has staff for, due to incentivized overtime, how big that margin can be before negative impacts and performance is the million dollar question.

The increase in the cost of the incentivized shifts is also a factor, as that cost eats into the profits from the additional revenue they were intended to generate. The spike in cancellations followed as a lagging indicator of a gap in capacity too great to compensate for. The cost of added shifts also spiked as the company reacted to the cancellations.

The result of this project led to a formula the company could use to determine how much additional  capacity it could plan above baseline staffing, and still be reasonably sure the commitments could be met. This was based on seven years of data to account for temporary market changes. The project led to additional revenue, while improving reliability and internal and external customer satisfaction. Adjusting for fluctuations during the COVID pandemic was particularly satisfying to me.
